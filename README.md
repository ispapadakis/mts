# Risk Analysis Examples

These examples showcase the capabilities of the Python pandas, scikit-learn, and statsmodels scientific computing environments. It's hard to complain about these open-source environments that are actively maintained and enhanced. Let me make a few comments, though, to ease future users into what is really a new computational ecosystem. Scikit-learn tends to offer little in terms of model specification tests and is focused mainly on the maximization of statistical fitness. Statsmodels tends to have less well-developed help files, so your search engine will have to pick up the slack. Finally, pandas excels at processing big data fast. You might find it finicky at times, but often there is good reason for pandas particularities, which is to force the user to write computationally efficient code.

The following examples a based on the well known dataset of Air Quality Data in Beijing collected between 2010-15. This is a rich dataset (by now old, though), that has been analyzed by many researchers and practitioners before. Feel free to cross-check my results.  As you proceed to follow the links in my repository bear in mind that there is a lot of room for improvement in all of them. So, feel free to offer the gift of feedback. In addition, take advantage of these examples by highlighting concepts you might want to utilize in your own models.
